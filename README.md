This program creates a randomly generated maze by typing in a random number followed by either 'kruskal' or 'prim' into a text file named 'input.txt'.
The maze will also find the path through the maze, using DFS for Prim's algorithm, and a disjointed set for Kruskal's.
A maze will print out followed by a score, indicating how much of the maze was filled with the path found.
